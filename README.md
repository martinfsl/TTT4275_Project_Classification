# Project_Classification
Project in image recognition and classification in the course TTT4275.

This project consists of two tasks.
1. Classifier of iris flowers
2. OCR - Optical Character Recognition

1. task:

First task is creating a classifier that separates three different types of iris flowers based on the length and width of the petal (small) and sepal (large) leafs.

Designing an error free linear classifier.

This task consists of two parts:
* First part has focus on the design and evaluation of a linear classifier.
* Second part consists of analyzing the relative importance of each of the four features with respect to linear separability.

2. task:

Second task is creating a classifier that can classify a digit given a 28x28 pixel-array with grey-scaled values which represents a handwritten number.

This task also consists of two parts:
* For the first part, the whole training set is used at templates.
* For the second part, shall use clustering to produce a smaller set of templates for each class.
